Sorry Chris, I've done my best to make all the ! mark disappear, 
But some errors like duplicate lines I don't know how to remove it.
I copied and pasted from my another workspace that I worked before and then it doesn't go away....  
And another error I don't understand, I commented it in pycharm. (line 143) Sorry about that.
